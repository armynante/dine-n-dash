# Technical Specification

### Summary
-------------

The objective of this feature introduction is to integrate OpenTable reservations into our existing restaurant search functionality, providing users the ability to compare results from both OpenTable and Resy, thereby improving user choices and experience.

## Context Analysis
-------------

**Current Architecture**

The current architecture supports integration with Resy&#x27;s API for restaurant searches. It is designed with a modular approach, allowing for additional API integrations with minimal disruption.

**Feature Interaction**

The restaurant search feature interacts with the user interface, where search inputs are taken from the user and passed through to the API integration module. Results are then displayed back in the UI. This interaction currently exists with the Resy integration, and we will need to replicate this process for OpenTable.

**Feature Importance**

This addition is critical for enhancing user experience by broadening their restaurant reservation options. It places our application as a more versatile solution for restaurant reservations, increasing user engagement and retention.


## Current Limitations
-------------

The current system only supports Resy API, limiting the breadth of restaurant options available to users during a search. Results are returned solely from Resy, offering limited choice and competitive information.


## Recommended Design Updates
-------------

Incorporate an additional API integration module for OpenTable. Update the search logic to invoke both Resy and OpenTable APIs simultaneously. Design UI elements that distinctly display results from each API. Ensure modifications are backward compatible with current implementations.

## Technical Implementation
-------------

**API Design**

Develop a new API client for OpenTable using our existing API design patterns. This will include methods for sending search requests and handling responses.

**Core Logic** 

Update the search utility function to handle data from both APIs, ensuring results are merged and clearly attributed to their respective sources.

**Concurrency**

Implement co-routines to handle simultaneous API requests, allowing both Resy and OpenTable searches to occur concurrently without blocking.

**Performance**

Optimize query handling to ensure low latency in returning combined results. Monitor both APIs for response times and adaptively manage request rates.

## File Changes
-------------

| File  | Purpose | Reasoning |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| src/api/ResyIntegration.js  | Modify to work alongside new OpenTable integration. | To ensure Resy API integration adapts to coexist with the new OpenTable module without impacting existing functionality. |
| src/api/OpenTableIntegration.js  | Create a new file to encapsulate OpenTable API communication logic. | To maintain modular architecture, segregating OpenTable specific logic. |
| src/components/search/SearchUI.js  | Modify to present results from both APIs distinctly and manage user choice between providers. | To guide users intuitively through choosing between results from different sources. |
| src/utils/SearchModule.js  | Update search orchestration logic to merge results from both Resy and OpenTable. | Ensures that the core logic manages interactions with both APIs efficiently, providing a unified response. |
